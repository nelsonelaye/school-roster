# School Roster Program

## Introduction

This program is created to manage a simple school roster.I created this program as part of my organization task and to gain more practice on typescript.

The student data only contains the student name and their respective class grade. The operations/functions involve in this program include

- Add new student to the roster
- Get the list of student in a particular grade
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name also.

## Implementation

To implement this program in typescript, you've got to have typescript install on your system. To install typescript, simply use the code below:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

Then in your project folder, run the code below to generate typescript configuration file:

```shell
tsc --init
```

After writing the program in typescript:

```shell
tsc index.ts
```

...will generate the javascript file for the typescript code. Then I will run:

```shell
node index.js
```

...to run the javascript file to view the result of my code.
