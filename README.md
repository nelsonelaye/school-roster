# School Roster Program

## Introduction

This program is created to manage a simple school's roster. The student data only contains the student name and their respective class grade.

Also, I created this program to gain more practice on typescript.

The operations/functions involve in this program include

- Add new student to the roster
- Get the list of student in a particular grade
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name also.

## Implementation

To implement this program in typescript, you got to have typescript install on your system. To install typescript, simply use:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```
